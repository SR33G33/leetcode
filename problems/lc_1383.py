# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

# You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n .
# There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n . speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the i th engineer respectively.
# Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance .
# The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.
# Return the maximum performance of this team .
# Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 .
# Example 1: Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2 Output: 60 Explanation: We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7).
# That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
# Example 2: Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3 Output: 68 Explanation: This is the same example as the first but k = 3.
# We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team.
# That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
# Example 3: Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4 Output: 72 Constraints: 1 <= k <= n <= 10 5 speed.length == n efficiency.length == n 1 <= speed[i] <= 10 5 1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10 8

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return
