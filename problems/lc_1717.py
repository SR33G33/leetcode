# 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings

# You are given a string s and two integers x and y .
# You can perform two types of operations any number of times.
# Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
# For example, when removing "ab" from "c ab xbae" it becomes "cxbae" .
# Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
# For example, when removing "ba" from "cabx ba e" it becomes "cabxe" .
# Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s .
# Example 1: Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5 Output: 19 Explanation: - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaa ba b".
# Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaa ab ".
# Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcb ba a".
# Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
# - Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbc ba ".
# Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
# Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
# Example 2: Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4 Output: 20 Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 10 5 1 <= x, y <= 10 4 s consists of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        return
