# 624. Maximum Distance in Arrays

# You are given m arrays , where each array is sorted in ascending order .
# You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance.
# We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a - b| .
# Return the maximum distance .
# Example 1: Input: arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]] Output: 4 Explanation: One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
# Example 2: Input: arrays = [[1],[1]] Output: 0 Constraints: m == arrays.length 2 <= m <= 10 5 1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500 -10 4 <= arrays[i][j] <= 10 4 arrays[i] is sorted in ascending order .
# There will be at most 10 5 integers in all the arrays.
