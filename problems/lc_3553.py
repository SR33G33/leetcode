# 3553. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths II

# You are given an undirected weighted tree with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1 .
# It is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , w i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes u i and v i with weight w i .â€‹ Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array queries , where queries[j] = [src1 j , src2 j , dest j ] .
# Return an array answer of length equal to queries.length , where answer[j] is the minimum total weight of a subtree such that it is possible to reach dest j from both src1 j and src2 j using edges in this subtree.
# A subtree here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.
# Example 1: Input: edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]] Output: [12,11] Explanation: The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer. answer[0] : The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 2 and src2 = 3 to dest = 4 is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 . answer[1] : The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 2 to dest = 5 is 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 .
# Example 2: Input: edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]] Output: [15] Explanation: answer[0] : The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 1 to dest = 2 is 8 + 7 = 15 .
# Constraints: 3 <= n <= 10 5 edges.length == n - 1 edges[i].length == 3 0 <= u i , v i < n 1 <= w i <= 10 4 1 <= queries.length <= 10 5 queries[j].length == 3 0 <= src1 j , src2 j , dest j < n src1 j , src2 j , and dest j are pairwise distinct.
# The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
