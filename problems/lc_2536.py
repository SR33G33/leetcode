# 2536. Increment Submatrices by One

# You are given a positive integer n , indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.
# You are also given a 2D integer array query .
# For each query[i] = [row1 i , col1 i , row2 i , col2 i ] , you should do the following operation: Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1 i , col1 i ) and the bottom right corner (row2 i , col2 i ) .
# That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1 i <= x <= row2 i and col1 i <= y <= col2 i .
# Return the matrix mat after performing every query.
# Example 1: Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]] Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]] Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
# - In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
# - In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
# Example 2: Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]] Output: [[1,1],[1,1]] Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
# - In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
# Constraints: 1 <= n <= 500 1 <= queries.length <= 10 4 0 <= row1 i <= row2 i < n 0 <= col1 i <= col2 i < n
