# 447. Number of Boomerangs

# You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct , where points[i] = [x i , y i ] .
# A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters) .
# Return the number of boomerangs .
# Example 1: Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]] Output: 2 Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].
# Example 2: Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]] Output: 2
# Example 3: Input: points = [[1,1]] Output: 0 Constraints: n == points.length 1 <= n <= 500 points[i].length == 2 -10 4 <= x i , y i <= 10 4 All the points are unique .

class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return
