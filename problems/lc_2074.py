# 2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups

# You are given the head of a linked list.
# The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers ( 1, 2, 3, 4, ... ).
# The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it.
# In other words, The 1 st node is assigned to the first group.
# The 2 nd and the 3 rd nodes are assigned to the second group.
# The 4 th , 5 th , and 6 th nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.
# Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second to last group .
# Reverse the nodes in each group with an even length, and return the head of the modified linked list .
# Example 1: Input: head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4] Output: [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7] Explanation: - The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
# - The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
# - The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
# - The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
# Example 2: Input: head = [1,1,0,6] Output: [1,0,1,6] Explanation: - The length of the first group is 1.
# No reversal occurs.
# - The length of the second group is 2.
# The nodes are reversed.
# - The length of the last group is 1.
# No reversal occurs.
# Example 3: Input: head = [1,1,0,6,5] Output: [1,0,1,5,6] Explanation: - The length of the first group is 1.
# No reversal occurs.
# - The length of the second group is 2.
# The nodes are reversed.
# - The length of the last group is 2.
# The nodes are reversed.
# Constraints: The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10 5 ] . 0 <= Node.val <= 10 5

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
