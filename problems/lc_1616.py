# 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome

# You are given two strings a and b of the same length.
# Choose an index and split both strings at the same index , splitting a into two strings: a prefix and a suffix where a = a prefix + a suffix , and splitting b into two strings: b prefix and b suffix where b = b prefix + b suffix .
# Check if a prefix + b suffix or b prefix + a suffix forms a palindrome.
# When you split a string s into s prefix and s suffix , either s suffix or s prefix is allowed to be empty.
# For example, if s = "abc" , then "" + "abc" , "a" + "bc" , "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid splits.
# Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false .
# Notice that x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y .
# Example 1: Input: a = "x", b = "y" Output: true Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
# a prefix = "", a suffix = "x"
# b prefix = "", b suffix = "y"
# Then, a prefix + b suffix = "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.
# Example 2: Input: a = "xbdef", b = "xecab" Output: false
# Example 3: Input: a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu" Output: true Explaination: Split them at index 3:
# a prefix = "ula", a suffix = "cfd"
# b prefix = "jiz", b suffix = "alu"
# Then, a prefix + b suffix = "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.
# Constraints: 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10 5 a.length == b.length a and b consist of lowercase English letters
