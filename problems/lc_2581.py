# 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes

# Alice has an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 .
# The tree is represented as a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [a i , b i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a i and b i in the tree.
# Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree.
# She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree.
# In one guess, he does the following: Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.
# He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.
# Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [u j , v j ] indicates Bob guessed u j to be the parent of v j .
# Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that at least k of his guesses are true .
# Given the 2D integer arrays edges , guesses and the integer k , return the number of possible nodes that can be the root of Alice's tree .
# If there is no such tree, return 0 .
# Example 1: Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3 Output: 3 Explanation: Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
# Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
# Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
# Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
# Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
# Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.
# Example 2: Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1 Output: 5 Explanation: Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
# Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]
# Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,4]
# Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
# Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
# Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess.
# Constraints: edges.length == n - 1 2 <= n <= 10 5 1 <= guesses.length <= 10 5 0 <= a i , b i , u j , v j <= n - 1 a i != b i u j != v j edges represents a valid tree. guesses[j] is an edge of the tree. guesses is unique. 0 <= k <= guesses.length

    def rootCount(self, edges: List[List[int]], guesses: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        return
