# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

# Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
# As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# Example 1: Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8] Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
# Example 2: Input: root = [0,null,1] Output: [1,null,1] Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100] . 0 <= Node.val <= 100 All the values in the tree are unique .
