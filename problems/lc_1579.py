# 1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable

# Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and three types of edges: Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
# Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
# Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.
# Given an array edges where edges[i] = [type i , u i , v i ] represents a bidirectional edge of type type i between nodes u i and v i , find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob.
# The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.
# Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.
# Example 1: Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]] Output: 2 Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3].
# The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob.
# Removing any additional edge will not make it so.
# So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.
# Example 2: Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]] Output: 0 Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.
# Example 3: Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]] Output: -1 Explanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes.
# Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1.
# Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.
# Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10 5 1 <= edges.length <= min(10 5 , 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2) edges[i].length == 3 1 <= type i <= 3 1 <= u i < v i <= n All tuples (type i , u i , v i ) are distinct.
