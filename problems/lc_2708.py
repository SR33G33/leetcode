# 2708. Maximum Strength of a Group

# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums representing the score of students in an exam.
# The teacher would like to form one non-empty group of students with maximal strength , where the strength of a group of students of indices i 0 , i 1 , i 2 , ... , i k is defined as nums[i 0 ] * nums[i 1 ] * nums[i 2 ] * ... * nums[i k ​] .
# Return the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create .
# Example 1: Input: nums = [3,-1,-5,2,5,-9] Output: 1350 Explanation: One way to form a group of maximal strength is to group the students at indices [0,2,3,4,5].
# Their strength is 3 * (-5) * 2 * 5 * (-9) = 1350, which we can show is optimal.
# Example 2: Input: nums = [-4,-5,-4] Output: 20 Explanation: Group the students at indices [0, 1] .
# Then, we’ll have a resulting strength of 20.
# We cannot achieve greater strength.
# Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 13 -9 <= nums[i] <= 9

class Solution:
    def maxStrength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return
