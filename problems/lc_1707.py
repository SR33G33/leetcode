# 1707. Maximum XOR With an Element From Array

# You are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers.
# You are also given a queries array, where queries[i] = [x i , m i ] .
# The answer to the i th query is the maximum bitwise XOR value of x i and any element of nums that does not exceed m i .
# In other words, the answer is max(nums[j] XOR x i ) for all j such that nums[j] <= m i .
# If all elements in nums are larger than m i , then the answer is -1 .
# Return an integer array answer where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is the answer to the i th query.
# Example 1: Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], queries = [[3,1],[1,3],[5,6]] Output: [3,3,7] Explanation: 1) 0 and 1 are the only two integers not greater than 1. 0 XOR 3 = 3 and 1 XOR 3 = 2.
# The larger of the two is 3.
# 2) 1 XOR 2 = 3.
# 3) 5 XOR 2 = 7.
# Example 2: Input: nums = [5,2,4,6,6,3], queries = [[12,4],[8,1],[6,3]] Output: [15,-1,5] Constraints: 1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 10 5 queries[i].length == 2 0 <= nums[j], x i , m i <= 10 9

class Solution:
    def maximizeXor(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        return
