# 665. Non-decreasing Array

# Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element .
# We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i ( 0-based ) such that ( 0 <= i <= n - 2 ).
# Example 1: Input: nums = [4,2,3] Output: true Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
# Example 2: Input: nums = [4,2,1] Output: false Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
# Constraints: n == nums.length 1 <= n <= 10 4 -10 5 <= nums[i] <= 10 5

class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
