# 2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads

# You are given an array start where start = [startX, startY] represents your initial position (startX, startY) in a 2D space.
# You are also given the array target where target = [targetX, targetY] represents your target position (targetX, targetY) .
# The cost of going from a position (x1, y1) to any other position in the space (x2, y2) is |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| .
# There are also some special roads .
# You are given a 2D array specialRoads where specialRoads[i] = [x1 i , y1 i , x2 i , y2 i , cost i ] indicates that the i th special road goes in one direction from (x1 i , y1 i ) to (x2 i , y2 i ) with a cost equal to cost i .
# You can use each special road any number of times.
# Return the minimum cost required to go from (startX, startY) to (targetX, targetY) .
# Example 1: Input: start = [1,1], target = [4,5], specialRoads = [[1,2,3,3,2],[3,4,4,5,1]] Output: 5 Explanation: (1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1. (1,2) to (3,3).
# Use specialRoads[0] with the cost 2. (3,3) to (3,4) with a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1. (3,4) to (4,5).
# Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 1.
# So the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.
# Example 2: Input: start = [3,2], target = [5,7], specialRoads = [[5,7,3,2,1],[3,2,3,4,4],[3,3,5,5,5],[3,4,5,6,6]] Output: 7 Explanation: It is optimal not to use any special edges and go directly from the starting to the ending position with a cost |5 - 3| + |7 - 2| = 7.
# Note that the specialRoads[0] is directed from (5,7) to (3,2).
# Example 3: Input: start = [1,1], target = [10,4], specialRoads = [[4,2,1,1,3],[1,2,7,4,4],[10,3,6,1,2],[6,1,1,2,3]] Output: 8 Explanation: (1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1. (1,2) to (7,4).
# Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 4. (7,4) to (10,4) with a cost of |10 - 7| + |4 - 4| = 3.
# Constraints: start.length == target.length == 2 1 <= startX <= targetX <= 10 5 1 <= startY <= targetY <= 10 5 1 <= specialRoads.length <= 200 specialRoads[i].length == 5 startX <= x1 i , x2 i <= targetX startY <= y1 i , y2 i <= targetY 1 <= cost i <= 10 5
