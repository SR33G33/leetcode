# 3515. Shortest Path in a Weighted Tree

# You are given an integer n and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node 1 with n nodes numbered from 1 to n .
# This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1 , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , w i ] indicates an undirected edge from node u i to v i with weight w i .
# You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length q , where each queries[i] is either: [1, u, v, w'] – Update the weight of the edge between nodes u and v to w' , where (u, v) is guaranteed to be an edge present in edges . [2, x] – Compute the shortest path distance from the root node 1 to node x .
# Return an integer array answer , where answer[i] is the shortest path distance from node 1 to x for the i th query of [2, x] .
# Example 1: Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2,7]], queries = [[2,2],[1,1,2,4],[2,2]] Output: [7,4] Explanation: Query [2,2] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 7.
# Query [1,1,2,4] : The weight of edge (1,2) changes from 7 to 4.
# Query [2,2] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 4.
# Example 2: Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4]], queries = [[2,1],[2,3],[1,1,3,7],[2,2],[2,3]] Output: [0,4,2,7] Explanation: Query [2,1] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 1 is 0.
# Query [2,3] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 3 is 4.
# Query [1,1,3,7] : The weight of edge (1,3) changes from 4 to 7.
# Query [2,2] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 2.
# Query [2,3] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 3 is 7.
# Example 3: Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,5]], queries = [[2,4],[2,3],[1,2,3,3],[2,2],[2,3]] Output: [8,3,2,5] Explanation: Query [2,4] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 4 consists of edges (1,2) , (2,3) , and (3,4) with weights 2 + 1 + 5 = 8 .
# Query [2,3] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 3 consists of edges (1,2) and (2,3) with weights 2 + 1 = 3 .
# Query [1,2,3,3] : The weight of edge (2,3) changes from 1 to 3.
# Query [2,2] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 2.
# Query [2,3] : The shortest path from root node 1 to node 3 consists of edges (1,2) and (2,3) with updated weights 2 + 3 = 5 .
# Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10 5 edges.length == n - 1 edges[i] == [u i , v i , w i ] 1 <= u i , v i <= n 1 <= w i <= 10 4 The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree. 1 <= queries.length == q <= 10 5 queries[i].length == 2 or 4 queries[i] == [1, u, v, w'] or, queries[i] == [2, x] 1 <= u, v, x <= n (u, v) is always an edge from edges . 1 <= w' <= 10 4
