# 835. Image Overlap

# You are given two images, img1 and img2 , represented as binary, square matrices of size n x n .
# A binary matrix has only 0 s and 1 s as values.
# We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units.
# We then place it on top of the other image.
# We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.
# Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.
# Any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.
# Return the largest possible overlap .
# Example 1: Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]] Output: 3 Explanation: We translate img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
# The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3 (shown in red).
# Example 2: Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]] Output: 1
# Example 3: Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]] Output: 0 Constraints: n == img1.length == img1[i].length n == img2.length == img2[i].length 1 <= n <= 30 img1[i][j] is either 0 or 1 . img2[i][j] is either 0 or 1 .

    def largestOverlap(self, img1: List[List[int]], img2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return
