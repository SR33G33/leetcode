# 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score

# There is a class with m students and n exams.
# You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix score , where each row represents one student and score[i][j] denotes the score the i th student got in the j th exam.
# The matrix score contains distinct integers only.
# You are also given an integer k .
# Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the k th ( 0-indexed ) exam from the highest to the lowest.
# Return the matrix after sorting it.
# Example 1: Input: score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2 Output: [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]] Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
# - The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
# - The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.
# - The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.
# Example 2: Input: score = [[3,4],[5,6]], k = 0 Output: [[5,6],[3,4]] Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
# - The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
# - The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.
# Constraints: m == score.length n == score[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 250 1 <= score[i][j] <= 10 5 score consists of distinct integers. 0 <= k < n
