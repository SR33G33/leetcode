# 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person

# You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the i th seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the i th seat is empty (0-indexed) .
# There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
# Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
# Return that maximum distance to the closest person .
# Example 1: Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1] Output: 2 Explanation: If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
# If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
# Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
# Example 2: Input: seats = [1,0,0,0] Output: 3 Explanation: If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
# This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
# Example 3: Input: seats = [0,1] Output: 1 Constraints: 2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 10 4 seats[i] is 0 or 1 .
# At least one seat is empty .
# At least one seat is occupied .
