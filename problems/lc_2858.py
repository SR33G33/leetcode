# 2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable

# There is a simple directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 .
# The graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.
# You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges , where edges[i] = [u i , v i ] represents a directed edge going from node u i to node v i .
# An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node u i to node v i becomes a directed edge going from node v i to node u i .
# For every node i in the range [0, n - 1] , your task is to independently calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed edges .
# Return an integer array answer , where answer[i] is the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed edges .
# Example 1: Input: n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]] Output: [1,1,0,2] Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
# For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
# So, answer[0] = 1.
# For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
# So, answer[1] = 1.
# For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
# So, answer[2] = 0.
# For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3.
# So, answer[3] = 2.
# Example 2: Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]] Output: [2,0,1] Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
# For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
# So, answer[0] = 2.
# For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
# So, answer[1] = 0.
# For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
# So, answer[2] = 1.
# Constraints: 2 <= n <= 10 5 edges.length == n - 1 edges[i].length == 2 0 <= u i == edges[i][0] < n 0 <= v i == edges[i][1] < n u i != v i The input is generated suchÂ that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.
