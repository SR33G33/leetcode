# 2532. Time to Cross a Bridge

# There are k workers who want to move n boxes from the right (old) warehouse to the left (new) warehouse.
# You are given the two integers n and k , and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [right i , pick i , left i , put i ] .
# The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge.
# Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge.
# To move the boxes, the i th worker can do the following: Cross the bridge to the right side in right i minutes.
# Pick a box from the right warehouse in pick i minutes.
# Cross the bridge to the left side in left i minutes.
# Put the box into the left warehouse in put i minutes.
# The i th worker is less efficient than the j th worker if either condition is met: left i + right i > left j + right j left i + right i == left j + right j and i > j The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge: Only one worker can use the bridge at a time.
# When the bridge is unused prioritize the least efficient worker (who have picked up the box) on the right side to cross.
# If not,Â prioritize the least efficient worker on the left side to cross.
# If enough workers have already been dispatched from the left side to pick up all the remaining boxes, no more workers will be sent from the left side.
# Return the elapsed minutes at which the last box reaches the left side of the bridge .
# Example 1: Input: n = 1, k = 3, time = [[1,1,2,1],[1,1,3,1],[1,1,4,1]] Output: 6 Explanation: From 0 to 1 minutes: worker 2 crosses the bridge to the right.
# From 1 to 2 minutes: worker 2 picks up a box from the right warehouse.
# From 2 to 6 minutes: worker 2 crosses the bridge to the left.
# From 6 to 7 minutes: worker 2 puts a box at the left warehouse.
# The whole process ends after 7 minutes.
# We return 6 because the problem asks for the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left side of the bridge.
# Example 2: Input: n = 3, k = 2, time = [[1,5,1,8],[10,10,10,10]] Output: 37 Explanation: The last box reaches the left side at 37 seconds.
# Notice, how we do not put the last boxes down, as that would take more time, and they are already on the left with the workers.
# Constraints: 1 <= n, k <= 10 4 time.length == k time[i].length == 4 1 <= left i , pick i , right i , put i <= 1000
