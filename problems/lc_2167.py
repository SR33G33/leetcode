# 2167. Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods

# You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents a sequence of train cars. s[i] = '0' denotes that the i th car does not contain illegal goods and s[i] = '1' denotes that the i th car does contain illegal goods.
# As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods.
# You can do any of the following three operations any number of times: Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0] ) which takes 1 unit of time.
# Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1] ) which takes 1 unit of time.
# Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.
# Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods .
# Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.
# Example 1: Input: s = " 11 00 1 0 1 " Output: 5 Explanation: One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
# - remove a car from the left end 2 times.
# Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
# - remove a car from the right end.
# Time taken is 1.
# - remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle.
# Time taken is 2.
# This obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.
# An alternative way is to
# - remove a car from the left end 2 times.
# Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
# - remove a car from the right end 3 times.
# Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
# This also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.
# 5 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.
# There are no other ways to remove them with less time.
# Example 2: Input: s = "00 1 0" Output: 2 Explanation: One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
# - remove a car from the left end 3 times.
# Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
# This obtains a total time of 3.
# Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
# - remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle.
# Time taken is 2.
# This obtains a total time of 2.
# Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
# - remove a car from the right end 2 times.
# Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
# This obtains a total time of 2.
# 2 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.
# There are no other ways to remove them with less time.
# Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10 5 s[i] is either '0' or '1' .
