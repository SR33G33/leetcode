# 2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array

# A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.
# Given an array of strings arr , and an integer k , return the k th distinct string present in arr .
# If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "" .
# Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.
# Example 1: Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2 Output: "a" Explanation: The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
# "d" appears 1 st , so it is the 1 st distinct string.
# "a" appears 2 nd , so it is the 2 nd distinct string.
# Since k == 2, "a" is returned.
# Example 2: Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1 Output: "aaa" Explanation: All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1 st string "aaa" is returned.
# Example 3: Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3 Output: "" Explanation: The only distinct string is "b".
# Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string "".
# Constraints: 1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000 1 <= arr[i].length <= 5 arr[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        return
