# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once .
# Return the linked list sorted as well .
# Example 1: Input: head = [1,1,2] Output: [1,2]
# Example 2: Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3] Output: [1,2,3] Constraints: The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300] . -100 <= Node.val <= 100 The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        if head is None: return head

        currNode = head
        while currNode.next is not None:
            if(currNode.next.val == currNode.val): currNode.next = currNode.next.next
            else: currNode = currNode.next

        return head
